      <h3>What is VCS Data?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Charity Commission publishes certain fixed high-level information about registered UK charities</li>
  <li>Companies House: similar for registered limited companies</li>
  <li>Most UK counties have a “VCS” (an umbrella body for nonprofit work)</li>
  <li>Many of these VCSs will have unique data on nonprofits in their area
    <ul><li>Deeper than other data sets</li>
        <li>Wider than other data sets (including nonregistered groups)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Have a VCS Data Standard?</h3>
If VCSs shared their data openly using a set standard, then that data could have many uses:
<ul>
  <li>Traditional webpage directories used for referral (GPs, CABs)
    <ul>
      <li>Organisations that exist</li>
      <li>Tags for what they do</li>
      <li>Service provision information</li>
      <li>Who is funded (although this overlaps with Community Foundation data)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Web Apps bringing different data sets together</li>
  <li>Data Science</li>
  <li>Local Government Policy</li>
  <li>Central Government Policy</li>
  <li>Research</li>
  <li>CVSs thinking about how provision is spread, where are the gaps? </li>
  <li>Funders: thinking about where are the gaps? How can they be filled in?</li>
  <li>Transparency: improves quality of data; charity efficiency; disintermediates those who would ringfence the data for profiteering</li>
  <li>Helping provision data cross borders. Letting people look at data in a joined-up national way (many nonprofits cover areas which cross borders; people cross borders; so why not data too?)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Surely there’s a Standard Already?</h3>
No. See <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> for generic organization information. 
See https://openreferral.org/ for group profiles for referral in the US.

<h3>Who’s Behind OpenVCS?</h3>
Just me. Trevor Barton. Systems & Support Manager for <a href="http://ocva.org.uk">OCVA</a>. (But I’m discussing it with NCVO, Cambridge CVS, 360 Degree Giving and others.)

<h3>Help This Standard Grow</h3>
We’re considering submitting this to schema.org, involving CiviCRM developers, promoting it to NESTA, promoting it to the UK LGA, IODS…
