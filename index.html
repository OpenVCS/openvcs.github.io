       <a href="http://ocva.org.uk">OCVA</a> is the first UK "VCS" or "CVS" to publishÂ open data for the voluntary, community, charity and social enterprise (non-profit) sector. 
       CVSs tend to hold unique data sets. Many community and voluntary groups are not registered charities or registered companies. And even if they are, their local CVS may hold deeper information about them than are available from Charity Commission or Companies House. So CVSs have something valuable to share with the world. If the sharing is done using an agreed standard, the potential is greater. 
       <h3>Potential use cases</h3>
       Use cases for VCS data shared with the world in a standard format include:
       <ul>
          <li>Directories for public use</li>
          <li>Referral organisations</li>
          <li>Web apps</li>
          <li>Research</li>
          <li>Local and central government strategy work</li>
       </ul>
       
<h3>Standards are the Key</h3>
We're not precious about our own 'OpenVCS' format. It's just a set of fields in a spreadsheet for exporting and publishing data. With open data what's more important is having a shared standard. But we're ambitious; we think peer voluntary and community associations/councils across the UK could share a standard together. It could be ours, or an evolution of ours. Or something else. We offer our format as a proposed standard-in-progress. If everyone publishes to a standard, things can be done with it and it starts to become intelligence.
