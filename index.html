OCVA is the first "VCS" or "CVS" to publish open data for the voluntary, community, charity and social enterprise (non-profit) sector. We're calling our format <strong>OpenVCS</strong> and we are in dialogue about organisations like OCVA across the UK publishing their own data to this (or at least a shared standard) format.
<h3>Standards are the Key</h3>
We're not precious about our own 'OpenVCS' format. It's just a set of fields in a spreadsheet for exporting and publishing data. With open data what's more important is having a shared standard. But we're ambitious; we think peer voluntary and community associations across the UK could share a standard together. It could be ours, or an evolution of ours. Or something else. We offer our format as a proposed standard-in-progress. If everyone publishes to a standard, things can be done with it and it starts to become intelligence.
<h3>About our Format</h3>
Our format is derived from CiviCRM and uses the following fields. Replace {AREA} with county or city name (for example, Oxfordshire) and {REGION} with UK region (for example South East Region):

*Groups must provide explicit opt-in to be included in our data set. Upon joining OCVA or filling out a data submission form, groups are told that postcodes are used to provide map point data. If they wish, they can provide a slightly altered postcode. We are always on hand to help groups to do this.
